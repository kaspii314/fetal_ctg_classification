Used during pregnancy to monitor fetal heart rate and uterine contractions, cardiotocography (CTG) tests allow early detection of fetal distress. Typically, CTGs are manually reviewed by obstetricians and midwives. One criticism of this diagnostic tool is the tendency for the same CTG to receive different interpretations depending on the reviewer (high inter-observer variability rate). An automated, reliable method for reading CTGs would empower expectant mothers with the knowledge they need while also reducing burden on their clinical teams.

The purpose of this research project is to leverage machine learning to interpret CTGs. We explore feature extraction methods and classification algorithms in pursuit of our research question: How do Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors compare in predicting normal vs. abnormal CTG results given test metrics?
